# to watch-recommender

To-Watch Recommendations Engin Based  on the user's favourite movies or series, 
The input is just the user's favourite movie(s) or series(s) 
and it recommends to the user the top 6 recommended shows that the user can enjoy without having the headache of choosing something new to watch! 

Underlying this simple prototype is a web scraper that gets the best shows in IMDB and extracts the features of these movies. 
Then the model builds a similarity matrix that utilizes what's known as the Cosin Similarity metric to find the best shows. 

Enough nerding and have a comfy popcorn night ;)
